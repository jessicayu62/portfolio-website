            <p>Hey! I'm a third-year at Northeastern University majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I
                am seeking to broaden my technical knowledge by applying my in-class learning to real-life
                experiences.
                <br />
                <br />I love discovering how programming languages differ and what each is capable of.
                I especially enjoy seeing my programs come to life as I develop them into visually pleasing,
                easy-to-use applications.
                <br />
                <br />From January to August 2022, I was a Software Engineer co-op at Mercari US. Throughout this co-op, I rotated
                through various
                teams such as CRM and User Acquisition Backend, Machine Learning, and Data Engineering
                (DE), which is the team I focused on.
                As a part of the DE team, I worked with pipelines for third-party data ingestion to keep
                track of ad spending,
                as well as implemented processes to automate ad creation.
